# Credit-card-prediction-

This project focuses on predicting credit card eligibility using machine learning techniques.
We developed a model that analyzes an individual's bank and personal details to assess their creditworthiness.
The data-driven approach helps in making informed decisions for credit card approvals.
By automating the eligibility check, the process becomes faster and more efficient.
This solution can be integrated into financial systems to enhance customer onboarding.
